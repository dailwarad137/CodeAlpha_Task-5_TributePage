                    <summary>How A.P.J Abdul kalam is Pop Idol?</summary>
                    <p>As a Muslim steeped in Hindu culture, he was to many an oddity - a scientist who could recite
                        classical Tamil poetry, who played the rudra-veena, a traditional South Indian instrument, and
                        listened to Carnatic devotional music every day, but performed his namaz with no sense of
                        incongruity.He also touched hearts, as the outpouring of national grief at his demise has once
                        again made clear.His popularity was undimmed by his relinquishment of office. In retirement he
                        set himself a demanding schedule of speeches, notably to educational institutions, and had an
                        uncanny ability to connect with a variety of audiences.</p>

                    <summary>How A.P.J Abdul kalam known as Man of Simplicity?</summary>
                    <p>Abdul Kalam was also, unusually for an Indian who occupied the high positions he did, a man of
                        great simplicity.During his 25 years as a scientist based in Thiruvananthapuram, the
                        constituency I now represent in parliament, he endeared himself to ordinary people
                        everywhere.Legion are the recollections of his waiting patiently for a bus, having breakfast at
                        his favourite teashop, talking to people from backgrounds as humble as that which he had
                        outgrown. In this simplicity lay the secret of his ability to connect with people, across the
                        boundaries of age, class, religion and region.India has never had a more beloved president.
                        Active till the end, he left the world in mid-speech, as if to remind us that he still had
                        something more to say.The shock of his sudden passing has left a nation bereaved. India mourns
                        his death, but will long celebrate his life.</p>
